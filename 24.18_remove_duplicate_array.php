// question: Remove duplicate elements in an array / not done yet.
// array programming.

// Example
// Suppose you have an array: [5, 7, 5, 9, 7, 6]

// The element 5 appears twice.
// The element 7 also appears twice.
// The elements 9 and 6 each appear only once.
// If you remove the duplicates, you would end up with [5, 7, 9, 6]. Now, each element appears only once.
