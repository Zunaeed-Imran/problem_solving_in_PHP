<?php
// question: Arrays are disjoint or not
// array programming.

// Example: Suppose you have the following two arrays:
// array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// array2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// These arrays are disjoint because they have no elements in common. The output would be true.

$arr1 = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$arr2 = array(6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
