// question: Symmetric pairs in an array. / not done yet.
// array programming.

// Example: Suppose the array of pairs is [(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)].

// The pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1) are symmetric because 1 == 1 and 2 == 2.
// The pairs (3, 4) and (4, 3) would also be symmetric if they existed.
// The pairs (4, 5) and (5, 4) are symmetric because 4 == 4 and 5 == 5.

// So, the output would be:
// [(1, 2), (2, 1)]
// [(4, 5), (5, 4)]
